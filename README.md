# Word-to-Tangible: On-Demand Interactive Tangible AR
## Project Overview

Word-to-Tangible is an augmented reality (AR) interface that allows users to create interactive tangible AR scenes using speech-driven interaction. By leveraging natural language and hand gestures, users can register physical objects in AR, define their properties, and dynamically update content in real-time. This project focuses on applying the system for elementary math explanations, allowing users to manipulate physical objects while observing real-time changes in AR.

## Features
- Speech-Driven Interaction: Register and interact with physical objects through natural language input.
- Dynamic AR Content: Create real-time, responsive AR content that updates as users manipulate tangible objects.
- AI-Generated Equations: Integrate AI models, like ChatGPT, to generate mathematical formulas based on object interactions.
- Tangible User Interface: Use everyday objects as controllers to manipulate AR content and receive live feedback.
- Interactive Learning: Designed for educational purposes, especially in math and science, to make abstract concepts more tangible and engaging.

## How to Use
- Register Objects: Use speech to register objects. For example, say "This is point A" while holding an object.
- Manipulate Objects: Move or rotate objects, and observe real-time AR updates, such as distance or speed.
- Generate Formulas: Ask ChatGPT to generate formulas based on the objects' properties (e.g., "Show the time for a train moving from point A to point B").
- Visual Feedback: Receive live AR updates showing calculations and visual aids based on object movement.
